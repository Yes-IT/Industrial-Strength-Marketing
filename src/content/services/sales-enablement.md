    ## Why B2B Sales Enablement Matters in Manufacturing

    Industrial sales has changed. Buyers know what they need and can easily access information to inform their purchasing decision — which means your sales reps have fewer opportunities to engage. One of the best growth strategies for manufacturing companies is implementing an effective B2B sales enablement strategy which gives your sales team the tools and expertise they need to reach more qualified leads and close more deals.

    ## Industrial Sales Enablement Planning


    Before you implement a sales enablement strategy, you have to set the stage with goals, a framework for your system, stakeholder buy-in, and a rollout plan.

        ## Goals & Groundwork


        Sales enablement is a strategic initiative that requires organizational commitment. For it to succeed, there has to be a vision, a plan, a way to “sell” the idea internally at your company, and a mechanism for tracking progress toward your goals. These four foundational factors will lay the groundwork for a successful sales enablement program:

        - Identify stakeholders

        - Set sales enablement goals

        - Assess needs

        - Determine how success will be measured

        ## Industrial Sales and Marketing Alignment


        Your industrial marketing department or partner is one of the key stakeholders in a sales enablement project. For it to be successful, sales and marketing must share overarching goals and develop a common understanding of the buyer journey so that they can coordinate meaningful interventions. Here are some common areas of alignment to consider:

        - Determine KPIs

        - Define MQL(Marketing Qualified Lead) vs. SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)

        - Share sales and marketing resources

        - Integrate sales and marketing systems

        ## Rollout & Training


        Your sales reps need to understand what a manufacturing sales enablement means for them to buy-in, which means it’s up to you to lay the foundation for understanding why a sales enablement strategy is critical to your organization. This requires communicating with them about the process, defining individual expectations, and orchestrating proper training so that they can adopt the system and work it to their advantage. Your sales enablement rollout and training approach should be designed to:

        - Engage sales reps early and often in the development process

        - Train existing sales reps 

        - Incorporate sales training into onboarding

        - Plan ongoing training

    ## B2B Sales Enablement Technology


    Technology is critical to executing an industrial sales enablement program at scale so that your sales team can focus on what they do best. The key is to integrate technology systems early on to ensure proper organization, attribution, and access to customer data that will empower your industrial sales and marketing teams to be more effective.

        ## Manufacturing CRM Implementation 


        Your manufacturing Custom Relationship Management (CRM) platform should be the operational headquarters for your industrial sales team. And it’s worth the investment to keep them in it, so that it becomes an ingrained part of how they engage, sell, and report. Make your sales CRM the operational hub for your manufacturing sales enablement program by using it to:


        - Store key training materials and content

        - Enable easier collaboration on sales content creation

        - Create visibility for critical customer data

        - Integrate with other key systems

        ## Marketing Automation


        A B2B marketing automation platform (or “all-in-one marketing platform”) is an ideal way to structure communication between your industrial marketing and sales teams — and create full-funnel visibility. By coordinating marketing activities in a platform that integrates with your sales CRM, you can ensure that marketing and sales stay aligned and focus on what’s working to drive growth. Marketing automation is an effective strategy to help you:

          - Track leads to sale
          - Analyze breakdowns in the sales funnel
          - Facilitate ongoing conversation about quality leads
          - Share marketing assets for sales use

        ## B2B Sales Content Personalization


        In the evolving industrial buying landscape, the sales process has to become more individualized, or you risk getting lost in the ocean of information an industrial buyer is sifting through. An effective industrial sales enablement program has to cut through the noise and speak directly to buyers at a scale your organization can manage. Here are some personalization opportunities to get you started:


        - Version content for individual customers

        - Serve content that responds to the moment

        - Send personalized video messages

        - Automate the process with AI assistance

        ## B2B Buyer Journeys


        If you create content that doesn’t respond to the needs of your audience, you’re missing a critical opportunity to center on the customer. Industrial sales enablement demands purposeful content that responds to customer needs at every stage of the buyer journey. The first step in developing effective sales enablement content is understanding how customers move through the marketing funnel stages — and what messages matter to them when. Here are some insights on where to start:


        - Define your target personas for key markets 

        - Understand how they research, qualify, and buy

        - Identify content types that will help sway them

        - Determine how and when to deliver messages

      copy: >
        ## Sales Content Planning


        Chances are you have a lot of existing sales content that isn’t being leveraged. Take the time to understand what you have, as well as document opportunities to develop missing content that could impact the buyer journey. This will give you guideposts as you create and execute content that supports your B2B sales enablement program. Focus your initial content planning efforts on the following:


        - Perform a content audit

        - Document opportunities for new sales collateral

        - Plan and produce sales enablement content

        - Empower sales reps to create aligned content

        ## Sales Access to Content


        One of the biggest complaints sales reps have is that they can’t find the content they need, when they need it, which results in a lot of presentations prepared on the fly, in cars, or coffee shops. Eliminate this pain, improve close rates, and get your entire industrial sales team speaking the same language by providing easy access to sales enablement content. Here are a few key considerations:


        - Systematically organize sales collateral
          - Govern and update a content repository
        - Communicate about content locations and updates

        - Facilitate mobile access
