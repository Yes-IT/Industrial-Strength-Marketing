    ## Why do you need a brand strategy?

    Your industrial brand is more than just a logo. It’s a promise to your customers that your company is uniquely qualified to help them get something done, whether it’s finding a new compressor for a hydraulic pump or engineering an industrial air filtration system. Creating a brand strategy is essential to ensure that your company separates itself from the industrial pack.

    ## Get Started

    Don’t worry, creating a brand strategy isn’t rocket science (even if your business is rocket science). Think of it like creating a blueprint for your marketing and sales efforts.

        ## MISSION & VISION


        The mission and vision for your company are foundational in describing “why” you exist. These statements should capture the passion of everyone in your organization. They should account for the current state and the future. The key elements that your mission and vision statements should address:

        - Explain why your company exists

        - Reflect your core values and culture

        - Motivate and inspire employees

        - Be aspirational for what you can become

        ## BRAND PROMISE


        Your brand promise is “what” your company promises to deliver. It describes the value of what you offer to the market. This can be framed around quality of products, customer support, legacy of expertise and success in the market, and many other attributes. But don’t try to account for everything; no company can do that. What are the non-negotiables? What will everyone in your company stand behind? You can define your brand promise around:

        - Reasons to believe in your brand

        - Problems you solve

        - Scope of operations

        - Unique attributes; what sets you apart

      copy: >
        ## CORE VALUES


        Your core values are the “how” your company will fulfill its brand promise. Collectively, these values are what make your company uniquely qualified to deliver your promise. This could be a detail, such as committing to respond to customers within a specific time frame. A promise can also be part of the big picture, such as continuing to invest in research and development. Your core values are likely to revolve around:

        - People and personal integrity

        - Processes and efficiency

        - Products and quality

        - Innovation and sustainability

    ## EXTERNAL BRAND MESSAGING


    Brand messaging begins with discovering and documenting: who your customers are, what they want to accomplish, what their challenges and pain points are, and how you help them.

        ## CUSTOMER PERSONAS

          Your target customer personas represent the decision makers who ultimately decide whether or not to partner with your company. This can be challenging as there often are many influencers in the complicated and often elongated industrial buying journey. Your customer personas often come from these functional areas:
          - Leadership, such as an owner or decision-making executive
          - Operational, such as engineers and on-the-floor managers
          - Asset managers of people, materials or facilities
          - Finance, such as purchasing, accounting or corporate

      image_layout: left
      copy: >
        ## VALUE PROPOSITION

        Why should your customers choose your brand over the competition? This is you making a case why they should work with you. A value proposition explains how you will help a target persona, and how that service benefits them in their position and the company overall. So while you can offer different value propositions for each persona, all value propositions should have this in common:

        - Target – who you are communicating to

        - Value – why they should choose you over others

        - Need – how this helps them

        - Examples – so the persona can relate your message to their situation

      image_layout: right
      copy: >
        ## VALUE PILLARS

        Your value pillars can be specified to each customer persona but should always ladder up to your overall brand promise. While you offer the same products and services to everyone, what is important to an engineer is far different from what is important to a CFO. Your value pillars should:

        - Address what is important to your personas

        - Acknowledge their challenges and objections

        - Articulate what you can do for them

        - Articulate your brand experience

    ## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

    Developing an effective brand strategy requires that you understand untapped market opportunities, how your competitors go to market, and what you offer that your competitors do not.

        ## MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

        Market research can unearth key market metrics that you might not be aware of, especially in emerging or disrupted ecosystems. This is not your standard scouting of the known players in your sector but investing in how you can expand your network of prospects and clients. The benefits of investing in market opportunities include:

        - Identifying gaps in the market

        - Developing new products and services

        - Uncovering market trends

        - Marketing and selling more effectively

        ## COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE

        Competitive research is the in-depth discovery work to identify differences between your products and services and those of your competitors and also how they message and go to market. Where are the value gaps that your competitors are not filling for your customer personas? How you address those gaps compared to competitors defines your competitor landscape. Questions to ask:

        - Where do my competitors show up?

        - How do my competitors get visibility/traffic?

        - Where are they that I am not?

        - Where am I where they are not?

      copy: >
        ## UNIQUES

        You should be aware of what makes your competitors unique in your industry. Look at their brand messaging to see how their values compare to your brand’s value pillars. The more you know about your competition, the more nuanced you can be in your marketing and sales strategies and tactics. Differentiating your brand requires learning where your brand is outperforming the competition and where you fall short. The sweet spot you seek is at the intersection of:

        - What your customers are demanding

        - What solutions you offer to meet that demand

        - What you offer that your competitors do not


        Uncovering your brand’s sweet spot is where you should focus your communications when you speak to your customers at different stages in the marketing/sales funnel.
