    ## What Makes Industrial Digital Marketing Different?


    The industrial buying journey is elongated, often non-linear, and has many participants. A one-size-fits-all digital marketing for manufacturers strategy won’t work. You need a plan that’s specific to your business.

        ## Be Strategically Visible


        Search engine optimization is more than having a keyword in your page title. It is critical to understand how search engines see your website and adjust in real-time to account for changes in search algorithms and online rankings. SEO for industrials is part science and part art, but the key areas to pay attention to are:


        * Keyword focus for all pages

        * Eliminating technical waste in website code

        * Building depth of content in key areas

        * Growing off-site authority

        ## Content for Every Stage of the Buyer Journey


        Like [sales enablement](/services/sales-enablement/), the first step in developing the right content is understanding how customers move through the marketing funnel stages. Begin by creating content that answers the most prevalent questions for those stages. Build a content universe that users can self-guide themselves through to experience your expertise. They’ll appreciate it, as will search engines. To make sure your content is answering the right questions, you must:


        * Understand the members of the target buying committee

        * Research the keywords and questions people ask

        * Create various content types to answer questions

        * Keep content fresh and up-to-date

        ## Find B2B Buyers on Social


        Industrial buyers use social media more every year. They use social media to follow family, grow professionally, or engage socially. Any effective industrial or B2B digital manufacturing marketing strategy will consider social media and which prospects are engaging on which channels during their sales journey. While likely not the silver bullet in lead generation, social media can be  extremely effective for industrial B2Bs who want to:

        * Maintain brand recognition/recall

        * Conduct direct outreach via interest targeting

        * Share video and photo assets

        * Reach the widest possible audience

    ## B2B Paid Media Activation


    Prospects are surrounded by online advertising all day, every day. The key to a successful industrial media plan isn’t always more money. Often, it’s understanding the best channels to reach your audiences and which vehicles will offer the most bang for your marketing buck.

        ## B2B Paid Search Marketing


        Your search marketing will always benefit from being rooted in the active intent of your target markets. By understanding the search keywords and queries used by your target accounts, you can strategically place content or promotions in front of people actively looking for what you provide. When preparing to start B2B paid search, keep in mind:


        * More money doesn’t always mean results

        * Keyword research is a crucial piece of a paid search strategy

        * PPC is not a set-it-and-forget-it marketing tactic

        * The quality of the page your ads link to is important, too

        ## Programmatic Advertising


        By blending machine learning, data science, and automation, programmatic advertising platforms and exchanges can facilitate better targeting and deliver more qualified results of your spend. For most programmatic advertising, algorithmic software handles the placement of ads based on specific targeting criteria chosen by brands, but there are important distinctions that can help you make the most out of your B2B programmatic advertising: 


        * There’s a difference between DSPs, SSPs, and DMPs

        * Not all tools can target all industries

        * Self-service vs. partner solutions

        * Set realistic goals and expectations beforehand

        ## Industrial Trade Publications & Directories


        They may be traditional, but having a brand presence within relevant industry trade publications and directories is an integral part of a B2B integrated manufacturing marketing plan. Not only will advertising and sponsored content in trade publications help with visibility and authority, the backlinks from articles and directory listings can significantly improve website SEO. Trade advertising can get expensive, so approach your planning with specific goals in mind:


        * Establishing visibility in authoritative, relevant publications

        * Strengthening backlink profiles via industrial directory listings

        * Increasing credibility via sponsored content

        * Engaging audiences via supplemental marketing channels offered by industrial directories

        ## Build a Strong Industrial Website


        The center of your company’s online presence is your website. The best industrial website design can mean the difference between ranking on Page 1 or Page 10 for key search terms. Make sure when you launch any integrated marketing campaigns that your website destinations are technically and organically sound and you have verified:


        * Strong Core Web Vitals health scores

        * An accurate and crawlable sitemap

        * Site conversions are documented and monitored

        * No toxic backlinks are dragging down your site profile

        ## B2B Marketing Automation


        One of marketing automation’s biggest benefits is the scalability it can add to your marketing efforts. It’s similar to your current internal technologies like ERP systems and sales CRMs. The right marketing automation platform might be hard to find, but certified experts can help research, identify and launch the B2B marketing automation platform that will get you to results the fastest. When evaluating this type of tool, keep in mind:


        * The number of contacts you’ll need to import

        * Which tools are already in play that the new tool will need to integrate with

        * The primary activities you’ll be performing

        * What types of communications assets will need to be created or uploaded

        ## Account-Based Marketing


        The swell of new tech popping up around Account-Based Marketing (ABM) can seem overwhelming. Identifying key accounts and consistently delivering value to those accounts is a long-standing tradition in B2B sales, but the types of data gathered nowadays and the intent that can be identified before a plan is set in motion is like no other time in history. For a modern ABM approach to be successful, explore four foundational elements:


        * Identify if ABM is the right approach

        * Create a data-based Target Account List

        * Assess your content library for coverage

        * Connect all tools for proper attribution
