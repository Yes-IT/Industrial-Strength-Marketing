challenge:
  caption: With over 100 stocking dealers in its distributor network, ABB Baldor
    needed a solution that could mitigate distributors' challenges in building,
    marketing, and maintaining a 6,000-part online catalog.
  copy: For 80+ years, ABB Baldor had successfully sold its premium line of motors
    through a traditional distributor model. But by 2006, 9 out of 10 buyers
    were sourcing ABB Baldor products online, and the company needed to update
    its model to synchronize their catalog across distributor websites,
    incentivize distributors to sell online and measure its effectiveness.

solution:
  caption: At the time, this was the most successful dealer incentive program
    executed in ABB Baldor's history.
  copy: INDUSTRIAL's B2B e-commerce website development allowed ABB Baldor to
    manage its product database from one location and push changes in real time.
    Additionally, we created an in-house team to solicit, integrate, and
    maintain catalogs across ABB Baldorâ€™s entire dealer network as well as
    monitor phone calls and emails related to the system.
