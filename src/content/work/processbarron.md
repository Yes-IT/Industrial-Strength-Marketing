challenge:
  caption: After years of doing repair work, ProcessBarron’s engineering,
    fabrication, and installation staff had developed the know-how to deliver
    complete air and material handling systems capable of optimizing power
    generation facilities. They wanted to capitalize on this knowledge.
  copy: ProcessBarron, a maintenance company for power generation air and material
    handling systems, wanted to shift its lead generation efforts away from
    short-term, reactive service-specific engagements and engage prospects
    around end-to-end installations, system optimization, and preventative
    maintenance services, which represented a much higher average purchase
    value. Or put more simply, they needed a brand positioning agency to empower
    them with the tools to drive and prepare for business growth.

solution:
  caption: Central to INDUSTRIAL’s strategy for elevating ProcessBarron’s profile
    as a thought leader in the power generation field was an aggressive white
    paper and case study publishing schedule that spanned trade media and an
    onsite Learning Center.
  copy: INDUSTRIAL leveraged ProcessBarron’s in-house engineering expertise to
    position the company as a “total systems solutions” provider for
    power-generation facility air and material handling. Integrating  trade
    media, social media, onsite conversion, and lead nurturing strategies,
    INDUSTRIAL delivered a steady stream of qualified, higher-value prospects to
    the ProcessBarron technical sales team.
