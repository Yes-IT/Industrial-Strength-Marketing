challenge:
  caption: SMF needed to transform their business by driving leads for high-margin
    services, so the INDUSTRIAL team optimized the website to effectively
    communicate SMF’s custom fabrication capabilities and expertise in key
    verticals.
  copy: With a lackluster website and a beat-the-street sales process, Southern
    Metal Fabricators (SMF) – a vision-driven, full-service metal fabricator –
    needed a strategic online presence to showcase their custom fabrication
    expertise, effectively answer common industry questions to build
    credibility, drive bid requests, and expedite the sales process. It was time
    for industrial website development.

solution:
  caption: Now that SMF receives the majority of RFQs online, they can spend more
    time serving their fabrication customers vs. pounding the pavement for
    leads.
  copy: >-
    Working closely with SMF, INDUSTRIAL translated the custom fabrication
    expertise SMF had honed over 25 years in the business into an effective
    communications strategy, transforming a local business that once chased any
    opportunity into a regional fabrication powerhouse that strategically
    chooses projects.
      
    Through ongoing development of educational articles, technical whitepapers, and customer case studies that educate and drive prospects to Request for Quote (RFQ) functionality, INDUSTRIAL helped SMF build credibility, communicate unique capabilities, and share success stories with potential customers. 
      
    Today, the SMF production calendar is always full, thanks to a renewable source of bid requests via the website.
