challenge:
  caption: This amazing product from COATS was launching at SEMA in just two
    months, and it didn’t have a name&nbsp;yet.
  copy: For 15+ years, you could visit any tire shop in the country and find COATS
    low-maintenance wheel balancers and tire changers. COATS had engineered a
    new product equipped with the industry’s most user-friendly interface.
    Despite not having a name, COATS planned to launch it at SEMA in just two
    months. They needed a partner for their B2B product launch marketing — fast.

solution:
  caption: The key to this successful, B2B product launch wasn’t just having a
    well-designed and manufactured product, but also having everyone speak the
    same language on the product’s unique value proposition.
  copy: Designed to deliver a true balance, every time, the product practically
    named itself. INDUSTRIAL delivered naming recommendations and a visual
    identity, badged the product’s chassis, created a sales guide for COAT’s
    internal sales team and channel partners, and launched an email campaign to
    generate interest at SEMA.
