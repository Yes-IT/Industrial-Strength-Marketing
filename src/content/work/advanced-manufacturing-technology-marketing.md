challenge:
  copy: The Manufacturing Extension Partnership National Network (MEPNN) was
    developed to support the manufacturing industry across the United States.
    One of MEPNN’s missions is to help small- and medium-sized U.S.
    manufacturers (SMMs) adopt advanced manufacturing technology. But making
    SMMs aware of how MEPNN can help in this area has proved challenging.

solution:
  copy: INDUSTRIAL was approached by three MEP Centers — Massachusetts MEP,
    Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center, and Tennessee MEP —  to help them
    educate SMMs about MEPNN’s expertise with advanced composites,
    biofabrication, functional fabrics, and lightweighting technologies. To do
    so, INDUSTRIAL developed key messaging, a website, and templates that each
    MEP Center could use to communicate the benefits of these technologies to
    SMMs, as well as share success stories.
