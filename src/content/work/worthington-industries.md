challenge:
  caption: Worthington wanted to shift its customers’ focus from cylinder unit
    cost to total cost of ownership for thousands of units over time. This
    fundamental change would mean millions in sales for Worthington — and
    millions saved by its customers.
  copy: Worthington Industries, a global manufacturer of pressure cylinders,
    wanted to shift sales conversations away from up-front costs and toward
    total cost of ownership (TCO). This change would give Worthington a platform
    for winning against less expensive Chinese imports by encouraging prospects
    to consider the lifetime savings offered by Worthington’s higher-quality,
    lighter products. It was time for a new B2B Content Marketing Strategy.

solution:
  caption: The report, infographic, and video produced by INDUSTRIAL drove home
    the TCO message and were designed to be deployed during key moments in the
    buyer’s decision making process — both as marketing assets and sales tools.
  copy: "INDUSTRIAL devised a plan to brand Worthington’s way of calculating TCO
    “The Worthington Method,” creating communications assets — including a
    report, infographic, and video —  that could be used by the Worthington
    sales force to deliver a consistent presentation establishing the importance
    of TCO thinking for pressure cylinder purchasers — and Worthington’s
    leadership in this area. The result: Worthington Industries offered more ROI
    in a globally competitive market through content marketing for B2B."
