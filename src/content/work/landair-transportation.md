challenge:
  caption: Drivers are bombarded with ads — to the point of advertisers losing
    attention because drivers don’t know where to focus, or worse, because the
    content isn’t relevant or compelling.
  copy: There is a lot of noise in truck driver recruiting. Landair, an
    asset-based transportation and logistics company, wanted to grow its driver
    resources pool without spending the same media dollars on interruptive
    advertising as the top transportation companies. They required new truck
    driver recruiting strategies to make better use of their recruiting dollars.

solution:
  caption: Attention is a valuable asset, so our approach focused on leveraging
    multiple  channels to ensure we deliver relevant content at every stage in
    the driver journey.
  copy: >-
    Rather than inundate drivers with ads, we developed a mobile-friendly
    job  portal and targeted content strategy to directly engage drivers across
    search,
     social, and email at a fraction of the cost. Not only was cost per hire 
     reduced by 30%, but Landair also saw a 94.3% peak increase in orientation 
     attendance — the best in company history.
