challenge:
  caption: "Despite its success as a field sales tool, Wearwell’s distributors
    were uncomfortable with the amount of time it took to conduct an on-site
    survey. "
  copy: Wearwell, the nation’s No. 1 industrial ergonomic flooring and matting
    manufacturer, had offered a successful on-site needs assessment service for
    years. Although an effective sales tool, the process of completing these
    paper-based surveys was cumbersome for Wearwell distribution partners,<br>so
    adoption suffered. The solution came in mobile apps for the manufacturing
    industry.

solution:
  caption: "Wearwell reps could survey sites and save recommendations on one
    device, then re-open later on another to push assessments to Wearwell HQ for
    faster, in-depth quoting. "
  copy: Since many facilities lacked reliable Wi-Fi, INDUSTRIAL developed the app
    to perform offline, on any device, and work with preloaded,
    frequently-updated data to avoid onsite problems. With a nearly automated
    estimation process, distributors started including Wearwell as a preferred
    supplier due to their commitment to streamlining quoting and sales. Sales
    support came in the form of B2B mobile app development.
