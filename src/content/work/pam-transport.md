challenge:
  caption: In a media landscape full of too-good-to-be-true sign-on bonuses and
    other feature-based job selling techniques, PAM countered with an image of a
    company culture dedicated to professional development and respect for new
    and tenured drivers.
  copy: Most truck driver recruitment programs depend exclusively on advertising.
    Many carriers spend millions of dollars just to get drivers to apply. This
    results in a high average Cost per Lead (CPL) for leads that are never seen
    again. PAM Transport wanted a new, driver recruiting strategy to break this
    vicious cycle.

solution:
  caption: Central to INDUSTRIALâ€™s strategy was creating a website where drivers
    could apply directly to the company, rather than via media companies or job
    boards, creating a direct relationship with PAM and capturing contact
    information for later nurturing.
  copy: INDUSTRIAL created a "direct-to-driver" integrated recruitment
    marketing  strategy that leveraged owned content, targeted digital
    advertising and  marketing automation to generate and nurture leads. This
    approach not only  won PAM drivers in the moment, but kept the company top
    of mind with past  applicants, improved driver retention rate, aggressively
    drove down cost per  lead and reduced reliance on bulk apps and traditional
    media. It also empowered them to get better quality applicant leads without
    overspending on advertising.
