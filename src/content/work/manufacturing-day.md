challenge:
  caption: "Two million manufacturing jobs will go unfilled by 2025. Manufacturing
    Day seeks to narrow that skills gap by inspiring the next generation through
    first-hand contact with manufacturing. The first step: Motivate
    manufacturers to open their doors."
  copy: "In 2012, the Fabricators and Manufacturers Association, the Manufacturing
    Extension Partnership, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the
    Manufacturing Institute created Manufacturing Day, an annual celebration of
    modern manufacturing meant to inspire the next generation of manufacturers.
    The basic idea: Encourage manufacturers across the U.S. to open their doors
    to demonstrate what modern manufacturing really looks like. To transform the
    annual event into a national movement, they would need a new, B2B event
    marketing strategy."

solution:
  caption: INDUSTRIAL developed the MFG Day brand, created resources for hosts to
    mount successful events, developed a website where hosts and attendees could
    connect, and ran integrated communications and media programs to stoke
    participation.
  copy: INDUSTRIAL joined Manufacturing Day in 2013 as its marketing arm, creating
    foundational elements — including a visual identity and high-level messaging
    — to launch a strategic marketing campaign to drive event host and attendee
    participation. Every year since then, INDUSTRIAL has adjusted the campaign
    strategy to grow the movement and strengthen the event's B2B identity across
    the country.
