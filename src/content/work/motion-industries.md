challenge:
  caption: With government mandates on the horizon, these industry leaders came to
    INDUSTRIAL with the goal of educating potential customers on how motor
    upgrades could benefit their bottom line.
  copy: The Energy Independence Security Act (EISA) dropped a bombshell — all
    electric motors manufactured had to meet new premium-efficiency energy
    mandates. Motion Industries, a leading national motor distributor, along
    with US Motors & ABB Baldor, were determined to turn the mandate into an
    opportunity to take a leadership position in the marketplace. But first,
    they needed a B2B content marketing agency to create the right messaging to
    meet their business goals.

solution:
  caption: Any time an end-user searched for a non-premium motor, it triggered a
    series of digital ads that invited the user to learn more about a
    premium-efficiency alternative.
  copy: Combining digital advertising with dynamically generated content,
    INDUSTRIAL developed a campaign to directly engage end users searching for
    non-premium efficiency motor replacements. We delivered personalized content
    that compared their non-premium motor to its premium-efficient replacement
    and showed the long-term energy savings gained by upgrading.
