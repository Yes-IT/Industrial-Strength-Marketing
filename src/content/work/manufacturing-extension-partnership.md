challenge:
  caption: The backbone of the MEP program are its 51 Centers in the 50 U.S.
    states and Puerto Rico. All go to market individually with their own brands
    and approaches to marketing. No true national identity existed.
  copy: The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) coordinates the efforts of a
    national network of more than 1,300 partners to deliver impactful solutions
    to small- and medium-sized manufacturers across the U.S. After 28 years, the
    mission-oriented organization remained dispersed with national market
    penetration of just 2.5 percent. They needed one, manufacturing brand voice
    and guidance on how to develop a B2B brand strategy.

solution:
  caption: Central to INDUSTRIAL’s efforts to create and deploy the MEP National
    Network brand was the Brand Handbook — an operating manual for communicating
    as a brand representative that was distributed to all MEP program
    stakeholders.
  copy: INDUSTRIAL dug deep into the MEP’s history, structure, and stakeholder
    sentiment to develop a brand identity that unified the network and gave it a
    platform to go to market on a national level. INDUSTRIAL then equiped
    network staff to represent the brand and launched a multi-channel national
    brand awareness campaign.
