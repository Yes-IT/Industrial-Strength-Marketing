challenge:
  copy: The Tennessee Manufacturing Extension Partnership (TMEP) offers dedicated support to the state’s small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) with services that span process improvement, technology consulting, and workforce development. Many of the manufacturers in the state were not taking advantage of these services so TMEP asked INDUSTRIAL to help raise awareness for its programs and encourage Tennessee manufacturers to engage.

solution:
  copy: INDUSTRIAL created new strategic messaging that positioned TMEP’s key service offerings in the areas of automation, cybersecurity, process optimization, and workforce development so that they would resonate with SMMs. Each service area was represented by a landing page hosting a white paper that shared best practices. Google Ads campaigns, LinkedIn, and programmatic advertising were used to target individuals with the right job titles and firmographics, driving qualified users to the landing pages to convert.
