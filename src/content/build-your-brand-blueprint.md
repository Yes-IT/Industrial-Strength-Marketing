Do you find that everyone at your organization has a slightly different impression of who your company is — and what it stands for? Is this misalignment confusing your customers?

Overcome these internal and external roadblocks by creating a Brand Blueprint. This 1-page template can be used to define your “brand on a page” and align everyone at your organization around:
- **Mission** – Why you exist
- **Core values** – How you behave
- **Vision** – Where you are going

Once everyone at your company rallies around these internal brand features, it should be easier to communicate a cohesive brand message to your customers, including:
- **Brand promise** – The value you offer
- **Three uniques** – What you do that no one else does
- **Reasons to believe** – Proof of your promise

Download our proven 1-page template today to tackle all these critical dimensions of brand definition — and more.
