    -   title: Brand Strategy
        copy: Our Brand Strategy work allows us to come to a collective understanding, of who you are as a company, what your brand stands for in the market, who you serve, and where you’re going. We align your organization around the issues that could hinder a marketing program down the road. Your deliverable – our Brand Strategy Blueprint – gives you a strong foundation for years to come and a springboard for immediate action.

    -   title: Sales Enablement
        copy: What good is driving demand if your sales team isn’t equipped to handle the leads? And why begin inbound and outbound marketing efforts unless you’ve fully optimized your channel partners and empowered your sales team with the assets they need? Once your sales engine is fully activated and systems are in place to capitalize on paid lead generation, we then move forward with a cohesive integrated marketing program.

    -   title: Integrated Marketing
        copy: At the heart of an engagement with INDUSTRIAL, we plan, design, execute, and measure a mix of proactive short- and long-term marketing programs, based on the goals established in the Brand Strategy phase. As a full-service marketing firm, we iterate on your plan until the right formula is in place. And we don’t stop working until we hit your goals, even if that means working on our own dime.

    -   title: Analytics & Insights
        copy: We believe that good marketing starts and ends with data. That’s why our Analytics & Insights practice sits at both the beginning and end of an engagement with INDUSTRIAL. As the wrapper around other brand, sales, and marketing efforts, we use data to empower understanding, glean reports for insights, tweak and test every initiative, and then communicate actionable recommendations that impact your bottom line.

    -   title: Communicator
        copy: Many small and medium-sized manufacturers are finding that it’s more and more difficult to get leads through traditional sales prospecting. As supply chains shift and a new generation of buyers begins to take charge of sourcing, a different strategy is needed.

## Focused On Results
<p class="leadin">An industrial organization is complicated and interconnected. Dysfunction in one area can lead to health issues in another – just like the human body. So even though we love a quick marketing win as much as the next guy, we don’t just diagnose and treat symptoms. We instead look at root cause issues throughout the business, then implement a holistic mix of services across different practice areas.</p>
