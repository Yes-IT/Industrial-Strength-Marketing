With its July 1, 2023 deadline, the long-anticipated switch to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is looming large for many manufacturing marketers.

The first major Google Analytics update in 10 years represents a fundamental shift in how the Google web analytics platform records and processes data.

No doubt you have questions, which is why we recorded this webinar with answers!
<br><br>
Tune in to find out:
- What GA4 is (and isn’t)
- The main differences from Universal Analytics
- How to migrate to GA4
- What a “data stream” is
- What happened to Bounce Rate

The more insights you have into GA4, the sooner you will have the power to create a relevant analytics experience that can drive more growth for your company going forward!
