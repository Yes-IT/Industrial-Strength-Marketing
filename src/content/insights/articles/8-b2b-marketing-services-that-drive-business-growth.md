From the food on our plates to the stoves we cook on to the trucks that transport groceries to our stores, manufacturing and industrial companies like yours are essential to how we work, live, and play. However, your business growth relies on B2B marketing services to make it possible for industrial buyers to find your company and do business with you.



Here are 10 essential services that a [full-service B2B marketing agency](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/) can provide to help you kickstart your next B2B marketing campaign. These are just some of the ways a B2B marketing agency can help you take your next campaign from strategy to planning to execution.

## 1: B2B Marketing Services Often Starts With a Brand Strategy

Your industrial brand is more than a logo; it’s a promise that your company is better qualified than your competitors to help your industrial buyers get something done. Whether it’s finding a new compressor for a hydraulic pump or engineering an industrial air filtration system, creating a [brand strategy](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/services/brand-strategy/) is the first step to make sure you keep your brand promise.



This is why B2B marketing services often begin with internal brand alignment. You want to include key stakeholders who regularly interact with your industrial buyers, from customer service to sales to marketing. Rally your entire company to help you define your brand promise, including your mission, vision, and core values.



Together, your company stakeholders can give your customers and prospects reasons to believe in your brand, including the specific problems you solve and unique attributes that set you apart from the competition.

## 2: External Brand Messaging Drives B2B Marketing Success

External brand messaging is where a B2B marketing agency does the discovery work to properly identify your ideal customers and uncover the industry challenges that keep them awake at night. Then you and your agency partner can determine the appropriate messaging to show your customers how you can help them.



This may include developing customer personas that represent the decision-makers who ultimately decide whether or not to partner with your company. Because the industrial buying process usually involves multiple stakeholders, your personas may include leadership, operational staff (engineers), facility managers, and purchasing/finance.



Next, it’s time to develop your company’s value proposition. It’s important to remember that a value proposition is different from a mission statement. Your mission statement communicates your company’s goals, such as helping your customers solve problems. Your value proposition explains how your products or services solve these problems — for each persona — and the company overall.

## 3: A Competitive Analysis Can Differentiate Your Brand From the Pack

As we noted earlier, one of your key goals when enlisting an agency for B2B marketing services should be to convince industrial buyers that you are better qualified to get something done. But before this can happen, you need to make sure your brand stands out from competitor brands. A [competitive analysis](https://ism.industrialstrengthmarketing.com/brand-strategy-for-manufacturers) can help.



The analysis should begin with market research, to explore how your company can expand your network of prospects and clients. Your partner agency can then identify gaps and opportunities in your marketplace, so you can market and sell your company more effectively, which may even include developing new products and services.

## 4: Sales Enablement Planning Can Deliver Better Results

Before using all your marketing and sales resources to develop new sales collateral or sales promotions, it’s important to have a sales plan to get more value from your efforts. This is where a full-service B2B marketing agency can equip your sales team with the sales enablement tools and expertise they need to reach more qualified leads and close more deals.



[B2B sales enablement services](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/services/sales-enablement/) should be tailored to your organization’s sales process, but every sales strategy toolbox should include:



* Sales enablement planning to create the framework for systematic sales success
* Sales enablement technology to better guide and align your sales efforts and provide visibility, such as KPIs
* Sales enablement content to help your sales reps provide relevant information your customers are looking for in their marketing and sales journey

## 5: Integrate Digital Into Marketing Services for More ROI

Making the best use of your website and digital marketing channels should be front and center for all B2B marketing services. However, knowing how to balance [industrial digital marketing](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/services/integrated-marketing/) efforts with long-standing sales processes is immensely challenging. Your partner marketing agency can help you navigate this complicated ecosystem with an integrated marketing strategy that unites inbound tactics, lead attribution, and a refined multichannel approach.



This includes making better use of organic and owned marketing channels to:



* Make your company more strategically visible using SEO so industrial buyers will find you when they search online.
* Utilize paid media that goes beyond rote advertising, such as sponsored content that is relevant to your buyer and answers their questions.
* Reach more industrial buyers on social media to increase your brand recognition, share video and photo assets to increase engagement, and conduct direct outreach via interest targeting.



You may also want to invest in a B2B marketing tech stack to strengthen your website’s online presence. Your B2B marketing agency can connect you with marketing automation, similar to your ERP systems or CRM, to get faster results from your marketing efforts. 

## 6: Analytics Services & Insights to Keep Your Marketing on Track

Now it’s time to circle back to the original goals established during your marketing strategy and planning. At this stage, you should be able to connect as many data points as possible to identify what is working and what isn’t. The more you can identify where your revenue or successful outcomes come from, the more intelligently you can adjust your marketing mix.



A full-service B2B marketing agency should offer [marketing analytics services](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/services/analytics-and-insights/) to accurately measure key moments in the marketing and sales funnel, sort data so that it allows you to glean actionable insights, and improve your sales and marketing operations.\
\
These services may include creating new systems, such as a technology framework to connect all your marketing platforms. Reporting is essential, so your partner agency should collect comparison metrics to monitor and better understand your marketing’s performance. Then your agency can break down the insights and analysis to give you better visibility into what happens with interactions throughout the industrial buying journey.

## 7: Use Video Marketing to Humanize Your Company’s Story

A personalized video can make your industrial B2B brand feel more human. Adding this level of personalization doesn’t have to be complicated. It might start with some personalized product recommendations or promotional offers. Maybe it’s just a brief, sincere thank-you message. Saying thank you with video adds value in your communication channels, and separates your B2B brand from your competitors.



Video can also help nurture your prospects and buyers as they progress through your marketing and sales funnel. Consider enlisting your employees as advocates through video to demonstrate your company’s culture and values. This makes your brand more relatable because you have real people connected to it.\
\
These are just a couple of ways you can harness the power of [industrial video production](https://industrialstudios.com/) to elevate your next B2B marketing campaign.

## 8: Recruitment Marketing to Grab and Keep Top Talent

As you compete with more manufacturers and industrial companies for new business, you’re often competing with the same companies to grab the attention of the best talent. This is where a B2B marketing agency can help. It takes data-driven [workforce recruitment marketing](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/clients/workforce-recruitment-marketing/) tactics to attract, engage, and retain the best employees.



Your partner agency can help you position your company as an employer of choice and develop your employer value proposition. This includes working with your key operations and HR leaders to create targeted candidate profiles. This will help you better communicate the unique value that you can offer candidates — from core values and company culture to benefits/perks and opportunities for career growth.
