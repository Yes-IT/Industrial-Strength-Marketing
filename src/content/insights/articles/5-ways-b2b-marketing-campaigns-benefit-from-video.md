Video is fast becoming an invaluable tool for creating successful B2B marketing campaigns, mostly because statistics show that video gets results.\
\
Based on the annual State of Video Marketing Survey by Wyzowl, shared in a recent HubSpot update, more than [90% of businesses now use video as a marketing tool](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data) and consider video to be an important part of their marketing strategy. In the same survey, 87% of marketers are seeing a positive impact on their sales from video, including sales leads attributed to video.\
\
One reason video gets results is that it helps audiences better understand how a complex or highly technical product or service works. More than 95% of the surveyed marketers said that video has helped increase user understanding of their products and services.\
\
Given these statistics, if you’re using email and website content to educate your industrial B2B customers about your products and services, video may be your new go-to marketing tool. Video is also an effective way to make your manufacturing or industrial brand stand out in a sea of B2B digital marketing noise.



“Video is an exceptional marketing tool in the manufacturing and industrial marketplace because video makes you feel something,” says Jim Olen, Vice President of Video Production at [Industrial Studios](https://industrialstudios.com/). “Video should be part of your marketing strategy if you want your brand to make an emotional connection to your audience. It’s why video marketing is so effective!”

Let’s look at a few ideas for how you can harness the power of [industrial video production](https://industrialstudios.com/) to elevate your next B2B marketing campaign.

## 1: Video Improves Lead Generation for B2B Marketing Campaigns

Every industrial sales professional knows that trust is key to generating leads. Video is a great way to build trust with your industrial audiences and add value to your B2B marketing campaigns.



Being able to show your company’s products or technology in action builds your B2B brand’s credibility. Part of earning trust is showing that your company pays attention to details, such as nailing down the basics for using a new manufacturing cobot or the importance of air quality safety procedures for working with a new additive manufacturing material. These details help build loyalty to your industrial B2B brand and can even lead to repeat business and additional business referrals.\
\
There’s also the added benefit that your customers and prospects can share your industrial video across multiple platforms, such as social media channels, thereby extending your brand’s reach to a wider audience. This is how videos go viral, which could open the door to new sales leads from audiences you’ve never been able to reach before.

## 2: Video Nurtures Relationships With B2B Buyers and Customers

It’s no secret that the success of any B2B marketing campaign depends on your ability to nurture your prospects and buyers as they progress through your marketing and sales funnel. One way to keep your audiences engaged is to open the curtain to reveal the people behind your brand.\
\
You can get more value from your B2B marketing campaigns by using your employees as your advocates through video to demonstrate your company’s culture and values. There’s no substitute for video when it comes to showing how passionate your staff is about providing the best value for your customers. Your prospects will remember that passion and dedication every time they see your B2B brand. It makes your brand more relatable when you have real people connected to it.



Video is also a great way to break down complex concepts or technologically advanced product offerings more clearly and concisely. From air filtration system demonstrations to a tutorial on selecting a new metal fabrication process, visually explaining these concepts can quickly educate potential buyers. The video makes them feel informed about their purchasing decisions and saves them valuable time, compared to slogging through long instruction manuals or complicated explanations.\
\
Product demos, customer testimonials, narrative case studies, employee profiles … the possibilities of video to help tell your brand story are nearly endless. Video makes your brand feel more relatable and creates an emotional and educational experience that sets you apart from your competitors.

## 3: Video Personalizes Industrial B2B Marketing Brands

Industrial video production is one way to boost the effectiveness of your targeted B2B marketing campaigns, by personalizing your company’s brand.\
\
For example, if you focus your video content to target your prospects’ unique behaviors, demographics, and interests, your brand is more likely to make that personal connection that drives sales leads. For manufacturers, a personalized video can make your B2B brand feel more human. Adding this level of personalization doesn’t have to be complicated. It might start with some personalized product recommendations or promotional offers.



Or maybe it’s just a brief thank-you message delivered with passion and sincerity. Saying thank you with video adds value in an email, social post, or any other communication channel, and separates your B2B brand from your competitors.

Video is your brand’s mouthpiece to speak more directly to your target audiences, especially when it comes to addressing their specific needs in a way that connects on an emotional level.

## 4: Video Helps Increase Brand Awareness in B2B Marketing Campaigns

For more top-of-funnel industrial marketing campaigns, video can help you increase brand awareness and recognition within your customer base. Telling your brand story through video allows you to grab your potential customer’s attention and keep your brand top of mind. By using narrative techniques, your videos can continue to deepen your connection with your audiences, helping you get more value from your B2B marketing campaigns.

As your prospects progress deeper into your marketing and sales funnel, video can increase your user engagement and interaction. You can add interactive quizzes, surveys, clickable links, or CTA buttons to make your video viewers feel more involved in your brand narrative. This helps keep your industrial audience engaged and builds B2B brand loyalty. Interactive elements in video make your audience feel like they’re active participants in your brand story. They are then more likely to become brand advocates!

## 5: Video Elevates Customer Onboarding and Ongoing Training

After you’ve used industrial video production to make your initial B2B marketing campaigns more impactful, you can also use video to help onboard your customers or for new product training. As noted earlier, a video is more engaging than a slide presentation or a lengthy instruction manual. It can even entertain as you educate your new valued customers.



Imagine a customer trying to navigate a new industrial automation solution or the installation of a new cobot. Instead of overwhelming them with multiple pages of text, your industrial customers could watch a how-to video that walks them through the process, step by step. Seeing and hearing these steps in video can make it easier for your customers to understand and retain information, and can increase overall satisfaction as you nurture customer relationships.\
\
There’s no question that people remember a good story. They don’t remember statistics. They remember the story behind the statistics. They retain the information you give them when you use video with narrative techniques that make a true, human impression.

## Boost Your B2B Marketing Campaigns With Video

YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram Reels are all examples of how industrial video production is elevating B2B marketing campaigns to expand the reach of industrial brands.



By incorporating personalized and targeted messaging into your video content across more communication channels, you can cut through the digital marketing noise and create a meaningful connection with your viewers.
