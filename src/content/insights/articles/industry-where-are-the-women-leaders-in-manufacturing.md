*[Virginia Roberson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/virginia-roberson-85a5583/) is part of our INDUSTRIAL team on a fact-finding mission to surface the technologies and trends impacting manufacturers and to share what we discover along the way.*

In spite of the recent focus on diversity and racial equality in the workplace, women and minorities are seriously underrepresented in manufacturing, especially when it comes to leadership roles. According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm), women make up less than 30% of the entire manufacturing workforce in the U.S.

There’s also a shocking lack of widely available statistics on women and minorities in manufacturing leadership positions. But there are news stories of women and minorities creating their own opportunities by starting their own manufacturing businesses.

These women manufacturing entrepreneurs include:

* Vanessa Braxton, owner of [Black Momma Vodka in New York City](https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2020/05/11/no-time-for-saviors-black-and-brown-entrepreneurs-with-inspiring-responses-to-covid-19/#2d3b8f6a5f09), who in the wake of a COVID-19 financial shortfall, converted production from vodka to hand sanitizer. She sold over 8,000 bottles in her first three weeks of production.
* Pandwe Gibson started [EcoTech Visions](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-owned-manufacturing-company-brings-in-25k-a-month/), which is Miami’s first green incubator and makerspace. Her smart manufacturing company is averaging $25,000 in revenue each month.
* San Diego-based [Beauty Bakerie was founded by Cashmere Nicole](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elisabethbrier/2020/06/05/75-black-owned-businesses-to-support/#36db9dcf3814) to manufacture and market vegan, non-toxic, and cruelty-free lipstick and cosmetics.

Unfortunately, many women have been forced to start their own businesses to break into leadership roles. Given the 2019 numbers from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm), it’s safe to say manufacturers have more work to do when it comes to creating leadership opportunities for women and minorities.

INDUSTRIAL wants to help women leaders in manufacturing make their voices heard. With this goal in mind, our CEO James Soto is encouraging manufacturing marketing professionals – especially women and minorities – to [speak out on our Industrial Strength Marketing Podcast](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/insights/podcast/). James recently hosted [Lori Furnell](https://industrialstrengthmarketing.com/insights/podcast/recruitment-marketing-lori-furnell-walmart/), director of supply chain talent acquisition at Walmart, to discuss how manufacturers and transportation companies can use digital tools to attract, develop, and retain top talent.

Okay industrials, we have a lot of work to do. Let’s get started.
