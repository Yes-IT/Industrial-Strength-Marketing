This is one of the most commonly-asked questions when our team meets with industrial leaders.

You could look to heavily-quoted definitions of marketing, such as Seth Godin’s “marketing is a contest for people’s attention,” or the American Marketing Association’s rather lengthy definition that “marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”

To really answer “what is industrial marketing,” you have to go deeper than an agreed-upon definition and focus instead on the fundamental question behind the question:

*What is marketing, and what role should it play in my industrial business?*

In this video, INDUSTRIAL Founder and CEO, James Soto, details the three-part equation that can help you better define what industrial marketing is and what it means to your overall growth strategy as an industrial company.

Watch and learn:

* The three-part formula that you can use to create your own definition of industrial marketing and identify what it means to your business
* Why marketing — in addition to operations and finance — must be a distinguishing function in any industrial business
* Why it’s important to understand that defining industrial marketing isn’t necessarily about the industry or marketing as a discipline; it’s about you
