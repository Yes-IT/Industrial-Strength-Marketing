Like a rotten apple in a fruit bin, just one neglected online lead can spoil your chances of turning that lead into a sale.

If you’re waiting for that perfect “golden apple” of a lead, then you can bet your competitors will be happy to pick that fruit for you.

If you’re not responding that quickly to online leads, you’re not alone. Out of 2,200 companies surveyed by Harvard Business Review (including B2B and industrial organizations), [24% took longer than 24 hours](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads) to respond to their leads and 23% of companies never responded at all.

In this video, INDUSTRIAL Founder and CEO, James Soto, dives into why it is critical for industrial organizations to respond quickly to *every* online lead.

Watch and learn:

* How your ability to confidently access companies from online leads significantly “spoils” over time
* How the opportunity to get a sale out of each lead increases dramatically if you respond quickly
* Why lead responsiveness makes bottom-line sense for industrial organizations
