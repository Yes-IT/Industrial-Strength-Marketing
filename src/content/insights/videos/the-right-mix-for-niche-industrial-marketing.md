It takes more than a few well-placed ads to get results from your industrial marketing efforts, especially if you’re trying to reach a niche audience.

For example, if you’re creating marketing content for the additive manufacturing industry, you have to get into the trenches of their world. Trying to market to specifiers? Then you need to research engineering applications and learn what they do. Want to connect with automobile manufacturers? Then you’d better be prepared to learn lean manufacturing concepts.

Each segment of industrial audiences, from Tier 1 suppliers to metal fabricators, lives in a unique ecosystem and is focused on providing specific products and services to a niche market.

In this video, INDUSTRIAL Founder and CEO, James Soto, explains why it’s vital for industrial marketers to “walk the talk” when it comes to communicating with these audiences, from senior mechanical engineers to welders on the shop floor.
