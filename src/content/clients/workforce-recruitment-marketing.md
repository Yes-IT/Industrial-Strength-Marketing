    title: WHY INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH MARKETING
    copy: |
      For operators and recruitment marketers that must hire the most talented people and cannot afford lost momentum and revenue due to unfilled positions, INDUSTRIAL’s workforce recruitment marketing practice is an impactful, data-driven approach to attracting, engaging and retaining talent that increases performance and mitigates cost. 
      Every hiring campaign at INDUSTRIAL is executed from an integrated marketing strategy that is transparent, technologically-enabled and constantly measured to ensure partners see that what’s working is kept and what’s not is quickly eliminated.

    title: Position Your Company & Career Opportunities
    copy: Your company must be perceived as a business people want to work with and for. INDUSTRIAL addresses your employer value proposition and brand perception, and works with key operations, HR leaders and targeted candidate profiles to communicate the unique value that you can offer candidates — from core values and company culture to benefits/perks and opportunities for career growth.

  headline: Meet Talent Where They Are
  intro: For us, it's not about advertising at talent, it's about meeting them wherever they are in their journey — and connecting the dots to you.

    title: FULLY INTEGRATED FOR MOST IMPACT 
    copy: To ensure we are creating value at every stage of a candidate’s career journey, we develop an integrated marketing ecosystem with multiple channels that strategically support one another across owned, earned, paid, and social media. We take this perspective of finding the right mix of available channels to achieve objectives in terms of CPL, CPH, and other key metrics. Ultimately, we want to be where candidates are and to be ready to deliver the right message, at the right time, in the right context.

      label: Center on the Candidate
      copy: We begin with mapping the full candidate journey to create meaningful interventions that move them toward desired outcomes (e.g., enticing them to apply for your job). We map the entire journey — from “not-in-market” passive candidates all the way through existing employees — to address root-cause retention and inspire advocacy to drive referrals.

      label: Data-driven Decisions
      copy: We connect the dots to provide real-time visibility into critical data so it can be used to make strategic decisions that matter. From solutions design (creating a plan to aggregate data from various sources for truly full-funnel analytics) to Dashboard creation (with real-time visualization of KPIs to track progress and guide optimization), we take the subjectivity out of data, making optimizations easier to support and overall performance more effective.
