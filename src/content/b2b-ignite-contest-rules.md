### Governing Law; Arbitration
ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENTRANTS OR SPONSOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SWEEPSTAKES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF TENNESSEE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OF CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER STATE’S LAWS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION PROVIDES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIC EXCEPTION STATED BELOW, ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND SPONSOR MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION THAT REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR A JURY, AND MAY LIMIT YOUR RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL. IT FURTHER PROVIDES THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT, NOR WILL YOU BE ABLE TO BRING ANY CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. 

Sponsor may, without your consent, elect mandatory binding arbitration of any claim, dispute or controversy raised by you against Sponsor arising from or related to your participation in the Sweepstakes (the “Claim” or “Claims”). All Claims are subject to arbitration, no matter what theory they are based on or what remedy they seek, whether legal or equitable. If Sponsor elects arbitration, the arbitration will be conducted as an individual arbitration. Neither you nor Sponsor consent or agree to any arbitration on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator shall have no authority to proceed with an arbitration on a class or representative basis. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties involved. This arbitration provision applies to and includes any Claims made and remedies sought as part of any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative action. By consenting to submit Claims to arbitration, you may be forfeiting its right to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed. Either the National Arbitration Forum (“NAF”) or the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) must administer the arbitration. The arbitration organization that is selected will apply its rules, codes or procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is filed, unless any portion of those rules, codes, or procedures is inconsistent with any specific terms of this arbitration provision or this Sweepstakes, in which case the terms of this arbitration provision or this Sweepstakes will govern. These rules and procedures may limit the amount of discovery available to you. The arbitration shall be before a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, including the applicable statute of limitations, and will honor claims or privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator will have the power to award to a party any damages provided for under applicable law, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court. All fees, including attorneys’ fees will be allocated in accordance with the rules of the arbitration organization. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not state law, shall govern the arbitratibility of all Claims between you and Sponsor, including any and all claims or disputes concerning the validity, construction and performance of this arbitration provision. Any Claim or dispute as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision’s restrictions on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or classwide arbitration shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator, and shall be brought only in a United States District Court located in Nashville, Tennessee.
